Maybe to document performance improvements ;)</p>\n<p>Have a look here:<br>\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_eRLxCTCbsM/TwH1LK9Y5XI/AAAAAAAAAXE/NLgNNl6FNZo/s1600/bench.JPG\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_eRLxCTCbsM/TwH1LK9Y5XI/AAAAAAAAAXE/NLgNNl6FNZo/s400/bench.JPG\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Is it faster than MapReduce?</strong><br>\nYes! I recently read in the new <a href=\"http://www.manning.com/ingersoll/\">“Taming Text” by Grant S. Ingersoll</a> that the same amount of workload takes the same time, but in minutes instead of seconds.</p>\n<p>However, I want to benchmark it against the same dataset and on the same machines to get a fully comparable result.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Work</strong><br>\nBesides the benchmark against MapReduce and Mahout, I want to show the guys from Mahout that it is reasonable to use BSP as an alternative to MapReduce. I look forward that they use Apache Hama and BSP within the next year as an alternative to MapReduce implementations for various tasks.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/eddieyoon\">Edward</a> who made this possible!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"BSP k-means Clustering Benchmark","date":"2nd January 2012","description":null},"tableOfContents":"","timeToRead":1},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blogger/k-means-clustering-with-bsp-intuition/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"k-Means Clustering with BSP (Intuition)"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blogger/german-stop-words/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"German Stop Words"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1e9cd2ae-f095-5348-b87e-bff15de60b9e","previousPostId":"58b5ef3f-6752-52fe-a344-0ecf6b1e0971","nextPostId":"c350d7cf-3060-57bc-8ebf-0c7d7ed4e393"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2270107033","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
