It wasn’t just the stress (open source projects, work, study) that prevented me from writing, but more that I’ve found no really good topic to blog about.</p>\n<p>Personally, what I always found to be interesting are these news aggregation sites. You know them: <a href=\"https://news.google.com/\">Google News</a>, <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo News</a> etc. They are crawling the web, getting fresh articles about what happens in the world, group them together and present them. Also, they require a lot of machine learning and natural language processing- topics that most of my blogposts are already about.</p>\n<p>Since my last posts are more about distributing such algorithms, I want to focus alot more on the application of several algorithms and intentions in order to build up such a news aggregation engine. I know this is a topic where you can write several books about, but I think we can build a working application within three to five blog posts. My personal goal would be to derive a small Java application, that you just start with a seed of a few URLs and it is grouping the incoming pages in realtime- so you can watch the result in an embedded jetty web application by refreshing the site constantly. I currently have some simple parts of it clamped together, but they don’t act as a single application so I will rewrite this for the public ;-)</p>\n<p>Here is a rough topic grind what we need to cover in order to plug the system together:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Crawling and extraction of news articles</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Detect text encodings while crawling (otherwise you’ll get low quality results)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Article Classification (you have to detect that a site contains an article)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boilerplate Removal (you don’t care about the design, so remove it!)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Page Deduplication (Archieves or mirrors host the same article, we want to sort out those fast)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Topic modelling of news articles</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Named Entity Recognition (News are about people and events, so we have to detect them)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Grouping News</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hierarchical clustering with realtime extension</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will use frameworks for some parts of the task, some coursework from online courses, but the most things are written by myself. </p>\n<p>So stay tuned, I will start with basic crawling in the next post and how to detect encodings efficiently.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Building a news aggregation engine","date":"1st January 2013","description":null},"tableOfContents":"","timeToRead":1},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blogger/java-xor-swap-performance/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Java XOR Swap Performance"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blogger/build-basic-crawler/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Build a basic crawler"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2a03381a-99fa-5a2a-bc5e-5ab5afe0b058","previousPostId":"17ac235e-f4ed-5968-b37b-f3f6a70ba821","nextPostId":"1cb63642-01ae-5c4b-bde9-a1a9f6b6f5e0"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2270107033","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
