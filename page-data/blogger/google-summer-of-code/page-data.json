Especially my mentor: Edward J. Yoon.</p>\n<p>If you don’t know what my project actually was, have a look at <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HAMA-359\">Development of Shortest Path Finding Algorithm.</a></p>\n<p>Basically I want to create a scalable solution, that takes a HUGE graph :) and and provides a fast solution of SSSP (single source shortest path) problems.<br>\nLike I already told in the Apache’s Jira issue, I focus on a distributed Dijkstra algorithm that uses an adjacency list. So at first I’ll focus on sparse graphs. The adjacency list is stored into a BigTable structure, in my case this will be HBase.</p>\n<p>After I finished this, I will focus on a refinement of partitioning and if I have enough time I extend the Dijkstra with an A* heuristic.</p>\n<p>These steps are basically my plan for this summer :)</p>\n<p>Right now I started my first commit of Dijkstra’s algorithm, it currently contains the old BSP version which I started with weeks ago to get familiar with Apache Hama. It is actually a working example, so feel free to check out the code and run its main method. This will start a local multithreaded BSP with some sample data of the german wikipedia page of Dijkstra’s algorithm.<br>\nThe class is located here: <strong>de.jungblut.hama.bsp.BSPDijkstra</strong>.<br>\nThe repository can be found here: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/hama-shortest-paths/\">http://code.google.com/p/hama-shortest-paths/</a></p>\n<p>Please star this project and the jira issue :D</p>\n<p>I’ll keep you updated on every change and thoughts I made. <br>\nThank you very much: Edward, Apache Software Foundation and Google!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Summer of Code","date":"1st May 2011","description":null},"tableOfContents":"","timeToRead":1},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blogger/profiling-apache-hama-bsps/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Profiling Apache Hama BSP's"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blogger/shortest-path-finding-with-apache-hama/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Shortest Path Finding with Apache Hama"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"32875d1c-96d6-50c5-9efa-04374a9ff7ad","previousPostId":"40fc313d-e6e5-5482-a6e1-b6958af58bf4","nextPostId":"b7e49558-e990-5a85-8ea4-7d083ab16a3c"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2270107033","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
