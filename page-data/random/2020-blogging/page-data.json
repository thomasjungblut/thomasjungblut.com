Putting syntax highlighted code on there was always difficult and relying on 3rd party JS that always broke after some time, so having Markdown now will hopefully help in getting the content across in a leaner and longer lasting format.</p>\n<p>I wanted to quickly thank <a href=\"https://github.com/palaniraja\">palaniraja</a> that created this wonderful <a href=\"https://github.com/palaniraja/blog2md\">blog2md</a> script to export hosted blogs and convert them into Markdown. I used this to copy all the content over to this site and with very little adjustment I could have all my posts in here.</p>\n<p>Since this site touts itself as a tech blog, you can find the whole source code in <a href=\"https://github.com/thomasjungblut/thomasjungblut.com\">my repo here</a>. This contains it end2end, from committing content and site adjust to <code class=\"language-text\">main</code> and having GitHub actions to deploy it straight into the <code class=\"language-text\">gh-pages</code> branch.</p>\n<p>I’m going to start with one technical blog post tomorrow, that will explain the <code class=\"language-text\">Stoer–Wagner algorithm</code> in a step-by-step fashion. This algorithm is a graph algorithm used to determine the <code class=\"language-text\">Minimum Cut</code> of a graph. Before deep learning it was used in image segmentation, spectral clustering and it’s being used in detecting bottlenecks in any kind of flow networks.</p>\n<p>I implemented it as part of the <a href=\"http://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/\">Hacktoberfest</a> two weeks ago in my own and old <a href=\"https://github.com/thomasjungblut/tjungblut-graph/blob/master/src/de/jungblut/graph/partition/StoerWagnerMinCut.java\">graph library</a>, but I struggled a lot to find great resources outside of original academic paper and a badly written Wikipedia article.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nThomas</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Back to Blogging - 2020 Edition","date":"16th October 2020","description":null},"tableOfContents":"","timeToRead":1},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blogger/xgboost-bayesian-hyperparameter-tuning/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"XGBoost bayesian hyperparameter tuning with bayes_opt in Python"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/graph/mincut/mincut/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Minimum Cut - Stoer–Wagner algorithm"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ca1066e6-4031-57ec-b2a4-48e9b069af25","previousPostId":"b4dfe3e3-3857-5d8d-9e32-6a82cacebbf7","nextPostId":"f2920e83-517d-5f8d-8b3a-b66adb1c3a78"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2270107033","2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
